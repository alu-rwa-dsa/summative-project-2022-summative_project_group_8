Program’s Objectives
The beneficiaries of this Program are citizens of Kigali since the hospitals listed there are hospitals found in Kigali only.

A Hospital Appointment Booking System application that brings all the public hospitals in Kigali
Patients are to book their appointments after seeing the available time slots at a particular hospital.
If a patient cancels ahead of time, their time slot will be cleared for someone else to take it up.
A patient can also update their appointment details, by selecting another timeslot only.
The application’s real-time updating will reduce the waiting time patients spend at the hospitals and ensure that the patients can book their appointments ahead of time.
  The benefits the Program brings to the community are:
A streamlined workflow and practice management process
Enhanced efficiency of healthcare professionals
Faster patient-physician communication
Minimalise congestion in healthcare facilities
